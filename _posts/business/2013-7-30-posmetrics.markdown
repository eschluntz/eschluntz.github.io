<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/yc-backed-posmetrics-launches-ipad-based-customer-feedback-solution-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses/">Posmetrics (formerly PollVaultr)</a> was my first startup! While at Harvard, Merrill Lutsky and I both realized that everywhere we went, businesses wanted us to fill out customer feedback surveys, but we never did because filling out surveys later and online was such a hassle. The solution, we realized, was to put the survey right in front of the customer, before they even left the store! With a working prototype and a business plan competition under our belts by the end of the year, we raised money from an angel investor and left school to participate in Y Combinatorâ€™s W13 class.

We soon shifted our focus to hotels where our data was more actionable and built out industry specific features to differentiate ourselves. After growing to 6 employees and more than 50 installed customers, [we were acquired in July 2013](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/revinate-acquires-posmetrics--9bdb55c4).
