Aaron Cheng, Rob Gunzenhauser and I entered the 2012 Presidents Challenge at Harvard University and were chosen as 1 of the 10 finalist teams from over 170 applicants across all of Harvardâ€™s undergraduate and graduate schools. Our proposal was to process sewage in slums across the world in an economically sustainable way by using biodigesters to convert it into energy and fertilizer which would be sold at a profit.
