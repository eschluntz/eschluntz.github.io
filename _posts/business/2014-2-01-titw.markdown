Over January 2014 I traveled to Tanzania as part of the Tech in the World program to expose more CS students to international development. While there, we designed and built a system for the Ifakara Health Institute that would allow them to send Verbal Autopsy reports to and from physicians electronically, replacing a paper based system that could take over 6 months to process.

We taught short seminars on different CS topics at Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology and became close friends with many of the students there! We also visited a local tech incubator and talked to entrepreneurs about the projects they were working on.
