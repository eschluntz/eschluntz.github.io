For a semester long design project, I worked on parts-per-trillion precision HCl detector that will fly on the <a href="http://www.arp.harvard.edu/technology/long-duration-stratospheric-systems">Harvard / NASA "StratoCruiser"</a>, a long endurance balloon that can move around the stratosphere to investigate Ozone loss. In order to attain our required precision with strict weight and power constraints, we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_absorption_spectrometry#Cavity_enhanced_absorption_spectrometry">ICOS laser spectroscopy</a>, which measures laser absorption through a sample of gas.
