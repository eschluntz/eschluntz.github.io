During high school, I was the lead mechanical engineer on my school's robotics team. We competed in FIRST robotics and then the Vex Robotics Challenge, making it to the World Championships four years in a row. <br><br>

Freshman year we made it to the final match of the World Championships, and a different year we received first place in the Nationals Championships for our autonomous program.
