This summer I'm working at Google[x] in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/business/international/novartis-joins-with-google-to-develop-contact-lens-to-monitor-blood-sugar.html">Smart Contact Lens group</a>. The lens is designed measure glucose levels in tears and transmit information to your other devices. This will allow people with diabetes to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels throughout the day without drawing any blood.

We are also developing vision correcting lenses that dynamically change their focus like a digital camera, to help people with contacts switch between looking at near objects and far objects.
