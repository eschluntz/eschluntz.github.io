My applied physics seminar focused on designing, modeling, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVF_NW7GElU">building a stirling engine</a>. We learned the thermodynamics and operating principles behind the engine, and used them to model the theoretical efficiency of the engine based on a number of design parameters in Mathematica. Using Mathematica, we found the parameters to maximize efficiency and then constructed the engine. Our engine used metal bellows instead of pistons to decrease friction.
