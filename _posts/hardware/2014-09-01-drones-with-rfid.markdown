RFID tags are the perfect platform for sensors: cheap, small, and with an infinite lifetime because they harvest energy from RF signals when communicating. Their only problem is a very limited communication range. In this project with <a href="http://www.travisdeyle.com/">Travis Deyle</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jewang">Jennifer Wang</a>, we used <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/mobile-robots-and-rfid-tags-internet-of-thingsify-the-outdoors">mobile robots to distribute and read sensorized RFID tags</a>. <br><br>

We explored <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/adding-uhf-rfid-sensors-to-iris-for-aerial-farm-management">applications in Agricultural Monitoring</a>, <a href="http://www.hizook.com/blog/2015/08/10/mobile-robots-and-long-range-uhf-rfid-sensor-tags-internet-things">Infrastructure Monitoring, and Water Quality Monitoring</a>, and used autonomous aerial drones and ground vehicles to communicate with distant tags planted over a wide area.
