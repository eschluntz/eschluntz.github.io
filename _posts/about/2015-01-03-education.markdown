I graduated from Harvard University in 2015 with Master's and Bachelor's degrees Cum Laude in Electrical Engineering. My goal was to become a ‘Renaissance Engineer,’ with a broad range of knowledge across several disciplines so that I could approach problems from a holistic perspective. The issues we face today are too complex to be solved within a single specialty, and so I split my courses between computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and economics.

Outside of classes, I was the Co-President of RFC Cambridge, an autonomous robot soccer team split between Harvard and MIT (Now part of the [Harvard Robotics Club](https://harvardrobotics.com/#home)). I was also an Associate Director and then Technology Director of the <a href="http://www.harvardconsulting.org/">Harvard College Consulting Group</a>, where I worked on cases with both startups and Fortune 500 companies.
