On days off, I enjoy ~~mountain biking~~, sailing, skiing, and hiking. When I don't have quite as much time, I read science fiction, play board games, play tennis, and discuss politics with friends.

I am also an avid traveler and greatly enjoy getting lost in a new city or area and experiencing different cultures. Some of my favorite trips have been to Cappadocia, Vietnam, Singapore, Istanbul, and Dar es Salaam.
