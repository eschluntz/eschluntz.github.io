On days off, I enjoy mountain biking, sailing, skiing, and hiking. When I don't have quite as much time, I read science fiction, lift weights, and discuss politics with friends.

I am also an avid traveler and greatly enjoy getting lost in a new city or area and experiencing different cultures. Some of my favorite trips have been to Beijing, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Istanbul, and Dar es Salaam.
