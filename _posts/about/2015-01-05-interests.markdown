As an engineer and an entrepreneur, I am constantly looking for problems to solve or processes to make more efficient. In particular, I am passionate about automating or transforming the biggest bottleneck in a company or system. Automating expensive, labor intensive tasks doesn't just save money, but lets you do 10x more, changing the fundamental constraints of the system.

The most impactful problems require an understanding of technology, people, and business - focusing on any one area alone will not work.
