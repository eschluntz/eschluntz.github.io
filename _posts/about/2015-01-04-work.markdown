I'm the cofounder and CTO of Cobalt Robotics. Along with my cofounder Travis Deyle, we build indoor security guard robots for offices, datacenters, and warehouses.

Previously, I worked on SpaceX's Flight Software Team, leading testing for an entirely new fuel system on the Falcon 9 rocket in 2015, and on Google[x]'s Smart Contact Lens project, prototyping radical new uses for low power electronics in 2014. While at Harvard I dropped out to start Posmetrics. We were accepted to Y Combinatorâ€™s winter class of 2013, and later acquired.
