I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at Anthropic, working on Large Language Models. <br><br> Previously, I was the co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.cobaltrobotics.com/">Cobalt Robotics</a>. Along with my cofounder <a href="http://www.travisdeyle.com/">Travis Deyle</a>, we build AI-enabled, friendly, security guard robots for offices and warehouses. We're Series C, raised from top investors including Sequoia, and have deployed over 100 robots to customers around the world.
<br><br>
Before that, I worked on <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9">SpaceX's Flight Software Team</a>, testing an entirely new fuel system on the Falcon 9 rocket in 2015, and on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2014/07/15/google-smart-contact-lens-focuses-on-healthcare-billions/">Google[x]'s Smart Contact Lens</a> project, prototyping radical new uses for low power electronics in 2014. While at Harvard I dropped out to start <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/yc-backed-posmetrics-launches-ipad-based-customer-feedback-solution-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses/">Posmetrics</a>. We were accepted to Y Combinatorâ€™s winter class of 2013, and [later acquired](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/revinate-acquires-posmetrics--9bdb55c4).
