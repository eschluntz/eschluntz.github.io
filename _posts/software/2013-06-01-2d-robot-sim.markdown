My goal with this program was to create an environment where I could accurately simulate a robotic system without any hardware. The most challenging part of robotics is overcoming the physical imperfections, noise, and unpredictability in the environment. I tried to mimic this as closely as possible in the simulation by only allowing the robot to perceive its environment through "sensors" which add noise to their measurements.
