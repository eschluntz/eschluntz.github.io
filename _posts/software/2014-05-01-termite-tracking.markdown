It took 60 hours of tedious labor annotating videos of termites every time the <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/">Self-organizing Systems Research Group at Harvard</a> ran an experiment. Because of the experimental setup, off-the-shelf tracking software didn't work. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvjRvO5T-e4">By using standard image processing techniques, a model predicting each termiteâ€™s motion</a>, and small amounts of human input, I was able to largely automate the video processing, reducing the required labor from 60 to 3.5 hours.
