Using C++ I created a variety of physics simulations for a graduate class on Systems Development for Scientific Computing. I implemented an abstract graph class to represent my data, and applied it to several different problems including mass spring simulations, shallow water models, and geometric collision detection. <br><br>

The class focused on performance and maintainability, and in particular how to use strongly typed languages and representational invariants, preconditions, and postconditions, to write code that is provably correct and robust. Understanding CPU architecture and compiler optimizations allowed us to achieve incredibly numeric performance by avoiding the common pitfalls of high level languages while still making use of abstraction.
