Modern control techniques like LQR require an accurate model of the system they are controlling, but if that system changes changes you're out of luck. I designed an adaptive controller to maintain control of a drone even if one of its propellers breaks. The algorithm compares the drone's expected behavior and observed behavior to learn thrust offsets and correct them.
