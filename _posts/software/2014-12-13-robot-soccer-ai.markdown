Working on the <a href="https://harvardrobotics.com/">MIT / Harvard Robocup Soccer team</a> was a fun and fast paced engineering experience. We compete at a world championship tournament every summer, and spend the school year working on new mechanical designs and new behavior algorithms to out-maneuver and outsmart the other teams. I redesigned our Artificial Intelligence and planning software based on nested Finite State Machines, and dynamic planning of passing and shots, rather than pre-scripted plays.
