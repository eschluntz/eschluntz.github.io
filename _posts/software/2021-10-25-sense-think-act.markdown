I was recently featured on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2_89LMusoMaEol3MHCeQ_A">Sense Think Act podcast</a> with host Audrow Nash.

<iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6fD3MIrciI" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Audrow and I touch on the Cobalt robot’s aesthetics, patrols, elevator integration, operations, and ultimately the human/robot interaction.

For a full transcript of the interview, <a href="https://www.sensethinkact.com/episodes/5-erik-schluntz">see this episode on Sense Think Act.</a>

Thank you to Audrow and the OpenRobotics team!
